Kindlers is a single-player, puzzle game prototype
Built for the Global Game Jam 2016, Kindlers was Developed over the course of 48 hours. I was the sole programmer and technical artist for a team of five (Game Designer, 3D Modeller, 2D Artist, Sound Designer).

The puzzle mechanic involved aligning multiple fire birds, slightly offset in position and rotation, while each following the same input. The game consisted of five fully playable levels.
